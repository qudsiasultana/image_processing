# Image Processing Applications of Probability Theory

## Overview
This project involved working with MATLAB's clone, Octave-online, to perform probabilistic methods on 512x512 grayscale images for a deeper understanding of image quantization, compression, and histogram analysis.

## Objectives
1. To implement image processing functions and algorithms using Octave-online.
2. To understand the effects of different quantization levels on image storage requirements.
3. To explore entropy and Huffman coding as means of image compression.

## Methodology
- Loaded and displayed a provided grayscale image in Octave-online.
- Generated and analyzed histograms for both the original and the quantized images.
- Quantized the original image using predetermined amplitude levels, then graphed the result.
- Calculated storage requirements for the quantized image using both fixed-length and Huffman codes.
- Constructed a Huffman tree for visual representation of the coding process.
- Computed the entropy of the quantized image to estimate the probability distribution of amplitude levels.
- Summarized the findings in a comparative table for different storage methods and quantization levels.

## Tools and Functions Used
1. imshow for image display.
2. Custom functions for entropy calculation, quantization, histogram plotting, and Huffman coding.
3. linspace and related MATLAB functions for statistical analysis.

## Results
- Demonstrated the histogram's variation as a consequence of image quantization.
- Showcased the efficiency of Huffman coding over fixed-length codes in storing images.
- Identified the relationship between quantization levels and entropy, presenting the trade-offs between image fidelity and storage space.

## Conclusion
The project concluded with a thorough understanding of how probability theory underpins key aspects of image processing. Our analysis offered valuable insights into the practical applications of mathematical concepts in digital image storage and compression.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Developed proficiency in MATLAB/Octave-online for image processing tasks.
2. Enhanced understanding of probabilistic methods in the context of digital images.
3. Gained experience in working collaboratively within a technical team.
